                Upon receiving your gown and Academic
                <br>hood, you'll want to put in on to admire your
                <br>distinguished and refined look. Once the gown
                <br>is on, the proper wearing of the hood is an
                <br>essential part of the overall prestigious look.
                <br>

                <div class="list">
            <ol>
                <li>Place the hood around your neck and
                    <br> shoulders so that the major portion hangs 
                    <br>down the back and the velvet is up.                    
                </li>
                <li>For your comfort, you may fasten the cord<br> on the front of the hood to your shirt, dress<br>or gown to help keep the hood away from<br> your neck.
                </li>
                <li>From a frontal view, the velvet border should<br> be on top.
                </li>
                <li>To expose the lining, turn the velvet border to <br> the outside as shown in blue and white.                   
                </li>
